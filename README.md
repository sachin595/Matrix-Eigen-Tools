## Sturm Sequence and Bisection Method
In the project, I have implemented algorithms based on the Sturm sequence and the bisection method to analyze eigenvalues of symmetric matrices. The Sturm sequence is employed to determine the number of eigenvalues within a given interval, providing a user-interactive program. Additionally, the bisection method, enhanced by the Sturm sequence property, is utilized to pinpoint one of the eigenvalues with a prescribed accuracy. This approach offers a robust and efficient means of analyzing eigenvalues, particularly in scenarios where matrices possess real and symmetric characteristics. The project's implementation encompasses numerical techniques and interactive functionalities for eigenvalue analysis, contributing to fields like machine learning, quantum mechanics, and computational biology.
